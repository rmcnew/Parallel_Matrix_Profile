Building MPI Matrix Profile requires CMake, a C / C++ compiler, and MPI.

If you do not have CMake installed, please install it:  https://cmake.org/install/

Build the project using CMake for your operating system:  https://preshing.com/20170511/how-to-build-a-cmake-based-project/

For my Debian Linux system, I run the following commands to build:
1) cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 
2) cmake --build build --config Release 

After the build completes the binaries are found in the ./build directory.


To run the matrix_profile:

1) cd ./build
2) mpirun -n 4 -f ../src/hostfile ./matrix_profile --input-file ../test_data/input_time_series/AAPL.csv --output-file AAPL-matrix_profile.csv

The completed Matrix Profile is given in the output file:  AAPL-matrix_profile.csv
